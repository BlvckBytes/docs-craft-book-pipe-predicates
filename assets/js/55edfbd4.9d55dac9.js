While actually using this extension in a day-to-day situation, I noticed how I constantly found myself restricted by the limiting nature of numeric item-ids when it comes to specifying output-filters; this plugin of mine aims at integrating my versatile ItemPredicateParser seamlessly into the experience, in order to vastly increase the user\'s freedom.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
